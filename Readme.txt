Note：PIN is under the current test project，which pin would to be connected
      When detecting the IIC interface, the portA port must be disconnected

1 joystick
  
  Normal x range 0 - 4000
  Normal x range 0 - 4000
  Normal button  0/1
  
2 DAC * 4
  
  Measure channel voltage with a multimeter
  ch0  1.25v
  ch1  2.50v
  ch2  3.75v
  ch3  5.00v
 
3 ADC * 4
  
  Connect a 3.3v or 5.0v power cable and connect to channels 1 to 4 respectively
  The data of channels 1 to 4 will change accordingly  
  3.3v - 17000
  5.0v - 26000
  
  Waring: The left side of each channel is the ground wire, and the right side is the adc input pin. Do not short circuit
  
4 encoder
  
  Rotating code value left or right will increase or decrease accordingly
  Button will change by 0/1 when pressed

5 MATRIX
  The lights will flash red-green-blue

6 TEMPERATURE
  Display of temperature and humidity
  
7 air
  Display air pressure
  
8 luminosity
  Turn on the mobile phone flashlight, irradiate the components, you can see the obvious value change  
  
9 microphone
  When speaking into a micropythone, you can see obvious numerical changes
  
10 keyboard
   Press the key to display the letters on the screen
  
11 dc-motor
   Motor rotates after wiring

12 relay
   Insert the wiring into ch0-ch7, the channel light will be on with relay closing sound 

  
13 servo
   Servo rotation after wiring
  
14 STEPMOTOR
   Motor rotates after wiring


 
15 RS232
   After wiring, short the serial port (the second row, the second pin and the third pin are short-circuited), you can see that the display re_num data increases

 
16 RS485
   After wiring, short the serial port (the second row, the second pin and the third pin are short-circuited), you can see that the display re_num data increases
   
17 RFID
   After read card. Recognize the chip ID and print it to the screen.
